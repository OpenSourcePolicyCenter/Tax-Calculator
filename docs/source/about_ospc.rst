About OSPC
==========

The Open Source Policy Center (OSPC) seeks to make policy analysis
more transparent, trustworthy, and collaborative by harnessing
open-source methods to build cutting-edge economic models.

Background
----------

Policymakers increasingly rely on computer-driven models to predict
the budgetary and broader economic impacts of current and proposed
policies, especially those involving taxes and entitlements. Estimates
from these models often determine a bill's success or failure in the
legislative process and public sphere.

Projects
--------

OSPC's first project is building tools to analyze the budgetary and
broader economic impact of taxes. These models are completely
transparent and freely available to researchers across the
country. Additionally, an easy-to-use online interfaces will allow
students, policymakers, journalists, and informed citizens to interact
with the models and learn for themselves about the effects of
policies.
