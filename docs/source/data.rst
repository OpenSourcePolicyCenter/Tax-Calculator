Public Data
===========

This project relies on a micro dataset that closely reproduces the multivariate distribution of income, deduction and credit items in 2008, extrapolated to 2015-2025 levels in accordance with `CBO forecasts`_ available in Spring 2015. It is intended to match similar but confidential data used by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Additional information on non-filers is taken from the March 2013 Current Population Survey.
