Disclaimer
==========

The Tax Calculator is currently under development.  Users should be
forewarned that the taxcalc API (application programming interface)
could change significantly.  Additionally, the implementation is
subject to wild change.  Therefore, there is NO GUARANTEE OF ACCURACY.
THE CODE SHOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL
ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH PURPOSES.  Essentially, you should assume the
calculations are unreliable until we finish the code re-architecture
and have checked the results against other existing tax simulation
models.  The Tax Calculator will have released versions, which will be
checked against existing code prior to release.  Stay tuned for an
upcoming release!
