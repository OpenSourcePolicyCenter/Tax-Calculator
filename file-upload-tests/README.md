Cross-Checking Results from Tax-Calculator and TaxBrain File-Upload
===================================================================

The contents of this directory are for use by the core development
team only.  The purpose of the cross-checking is to test that
Tax-Calculator produces essentially the same reform results when
accessed in two different ways: (1) via the Tax-Calculator
command-line interface (CLI) tools running on a local computer and (2)
via the [TaxBrain file-upload web
page](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/).

The contents of this directory include JSON reform and assumption
files used in the cross-checking.  The local-computer results are
generated by the `cli-results` bash script in this directory.

The TaxBrain results are located at http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/<RUN>
where <RUN> is the number of the TaxBrain run.

The latest cross-checking results are shown below.  These results were
generated using Tax-Calculator PR#1250 (2017-03-17) and TaxBrain
version 0.7.9.  In the future these results will be generated with
both the CLI tools and TaxBrain using version 0.8.x of Tax-Calculator.
