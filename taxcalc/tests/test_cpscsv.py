Tests of Tax-Calculator using cps.csv input.

Note that the CPS-related files that are required to run this program
have been constructed by the Tax-Calculator development from publicly
available Census data files.  Hence, the CPS-related files are freely
available and are part of the Tax-Calculator repository.
