# Comparing Tax-Calculator and TAXCALC SAS results

This directory includes tools used to compare the income tax results
generated by Tax-Calculator with results generated by the [TAXCALC SAS
program](http://www.nber.org/taxcalc) developed by Dan Feenberg and
Ina Shapiro of NBER with assistance from IRS-SOI staff.

The tools included in this directory are intended for use by the
Tax-Calculator core development team and support the following
cross-model-comparison work flow:

  1. Generate a sample of tax filing units (INPUT).
  2. Generate OUTPUT from INPUT using the inctax.py script.
  3. Generate OUTPUT from INPUT using the TAXCALC SAS program.
  4. Generate tax differences by comparing the two OUTPUT files.

Steps 1 and 2 are accomplished by the commands in the
[compare1](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/taxcalcsas/compare1)
bash script (which will not execute on Windows).  Step 3 is
accomplished by (a) copying the INPUT file (as `compare-in.csv`), the
TAXCALC SAS program (`taxcalc.sas`), and the
[compare.sas](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/taxcalcsas/compare.sas)
SAS script to the same directory; (b) executing the `compare.sas` script;
and (c) copying back the resulting `compare-out.csv` file to the
current directory.  Step 4 is accomplished by the commands in the
[compare2](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/taxcalcsas/compare2)
bash script (which will not execute on Windows).

## Initial comparisons

The initial phase of this comparison project,
which was conducted during April 2016, involves generating four
separate INPUT files, each one of which contains 100,000 different
randomly-generated tax filing units for 2013.  The **a13** sample
units have no itemized deduction expenses and no childcare expenses.
The **b13** sample does have itemized deductions expenses, but no
childcare expenses.  The **c13** sample has both itemized
deduction expenses and childcare expenses.  And the **d14** sample
is similar to the c13 sample except there are filing units with positive
property income and a few couples with a very large age difference (to
test the EITC age-eligibility logic of the two models).  Each of these
four samples have been used to generate identical income tax liabilities
using Tax-Calculator and Internet TAXSIM as described
[here](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/validation/README.md).

The samples are generated using these commands:

```
./compare1 a 13 ; ./compare1 b 13 ; ./compare1 c 13 ; ./compare1 d 13
```

The generated `a13.csv`, `b13.csv`, `c13.csv`, and `d13.csv` files are copied
(along with `compare.sas` and `taxcalc.sas`) to a directory where
`compare.sas` is executed by SAS.  The resulting `compare-out.csv`
files are copied back to this directory as `a13.out-sas`,
`b13.out-sas`, `c13.out-sas`, and `d13.out-sas`, respectively.  And finally,
those files are processed using these commands:

```
./compare2 a 13 ; ./compare2 b 13 ; ./compare2 c 13 ; ./compare2 d 13
```

The summary results of this comparison exercise are in four files:
[a13.taxdifferences](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/taxcalcsas/a13-13.taxdifferences),
[b13.taxdifferences](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/taxcalcsas/b13-13.taxdifferences),
[c13.taxdifferences](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/taxcalcsas/c13-13.taxdifferences), and
[d13.taxdifferences](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/taxcalcsas/d13-13.taxdifferences).

The contents of these four cross-model-differences files are shown
here along with some commentary.

### a13 differences

```
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 19     52     52      0.01 [874]
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 25     36     36      0.01 [2633]
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 27     71     71      0.01 [2665]
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 28     49     49      0.01 [874]
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]=  4     54     54     -0.01 [17158]
```

These a13 comparison results show that there are no differences
between `taxcalc.sas` and Tax-Calculator federal income tax
liabilities, or in several intermediate tax amounts, greater than one
cent.  However, these results ignore the fact that the current version
of Tax-Calculator does not calculate the Schedule R tax credit;
instead it reads it in from a more comprehensive input file than
`a13.csv`.  The `b13` and `c13` differences shown below also ignore
the Schedule R tax credit differences.

### b13 differences

```
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 17   2086      0 -45500.00 [57063]
      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              205
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 18   1306      0  29432.00 [81587]
      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              205
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 19   1372     66   9712.56 [81587]
      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              205
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 25     33     33      0.01 [1274]
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 27    507    196  -9712.56 [81587]
      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              211
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 28    382     77   9712.56 [81587]
      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              205
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]=  4    266     55  -3287.50 [75773]
                       #big_inctax_diffs=              211
```

These b13 comparison results show that there are very few (211 out of
100,000) units with income tax liabilities different by more than one
cent.  The largest income tax difference is almost $3300 (for the unit
with RECID 75773) with the Tax-Calculator amount being less that the
`taxcalc.sas` amount.  The causes of these few differences will be
investigated.

### c13 differences

TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 28    397     70   9696.72 [21201]
      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              243
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]=  4    328     77  -3150.00 [29984]
                       #big_inctax_diffs=              251
```

These c13 comparison results show that there are very few (251 out of
100,000) units with income tax liabilities different by more than one
cent.  The largest income tax difference is $3150 (for the unit
with RECID 29984) with the Tax-Calculator amount being less that the
`taxcalc.sas` amount.  The causes of these few differences will be
investigated.

### d13 differences

      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              185
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 18    726      0  27050.00 [60137]

      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              189
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]= 28    354     72   8869.82 [66360]
      #big_vardiffs_with_big_inctax_diff=              185
TAXDIFF:ovar,#diffs,#1cdiffs,maxdiff[id]=  4    221     32  -3079.00 [300]
                       #big_inctax_diffs=              189
```

These d13 comparison results show that there are very few (189 out of
100,000) units with income tax liabilities different by more than one
cent.  The largest income tax difference is $3079 (for the unit
with RECID 300) with the Tax-Calculator amount being less that the
`taxcalc.sas` amount.  The causes of these few differences will be
investigated.

As indicated above, these few differences in income tax liabilities in
the **b13**, **c13**, and **d13** samples represent not only differences
between `taxcalc.sas` and Tax-Calculator, but also differences between
`taxcalc.sas` and Internet TAXSIM.
