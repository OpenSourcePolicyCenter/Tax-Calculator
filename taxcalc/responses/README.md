This directory contains examples of response assumption files that can
be combined and modified to construct your own response assumption files
that are stored on your local computer.

Such a response assumption file can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) along with policy reform
file for non-static analysis, or be used on your local computer using
the tc CLI (command-line interface) to Tax-Calculator, as described in
the [user
documentation](http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/index.html#cli).

[This document](ASSUMPTIONS.md) provides access to one or more
response assumption files and guidelines about their preparation.
