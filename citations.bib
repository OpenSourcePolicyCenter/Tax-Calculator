I also simulate the effects of a revenue neutral GAIN Act in which an increase in the marginal income tax rates in the top two personal income brackets exactly offsets the reduction in total federal tax revenue from the EITC expansion. In the case of the GAIN Act alone, the economy experiences short-run gains, but the increased government debt quickly crowds out investment and causes the economy to start shrinking signiﬁcantly. In the revenue neutral case, the cost is primarily in terms of large labor supply frictions and a reallocation of the household labor-leisure and consumption-savings decisions.},

The U.S. will need to raise more revenues in order to reduce these disparities, finance much-needed new services and investments, and address the nation’s long-term fiscal needs. This paper outlines policy options for raising a large amount of revenues primarily from the most affluent, first discussing potential incremental reforms and then focusing on four main options for more structural reform: (1) dramatically increasing the top tax rates on labor and other ordinary income, (2) taxing the wealthy on accrued gains as they arise and at ordinary rates, (3) a wealth tax on high-net-worth individuals, and (4) a financial transactions tax. Although we summarize the relative advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, we generally conclude that they all merit serious consideration. Several options are also complementary to one another. In practice, however, the relative strengths of each of these policies will depend to a large extent on how each is designed after it has made its way through the legislative and regulatory process.},

	abstract = {Middle-class tax relief has widespread support across the political spectrum, but the consequences of different strategies for achieving this goal are not well understood. Using a new modeling suite incubated by AEI's Open Source Policy Center, this paper evaluates stylized versions of middle-class tax relief options with respect to the average effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) on labor income, the number of taxpayers claiming the standard deduction, the number of taxpayers receiving tax relief, and the macroeconomic effects. The analysis finds that either doubling the standard deduction or expanding the brackets for the 10 or 15 percent tax rates results in lower EMTRs for taxpayers in the middle class, but that these policies have quite different effects both within the middle class and across the aggregate economy.},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {Recently, there has been considerable discussion of a signiﬁcant increase in the top marginal income tax rate. A salient top marginal tax rate is 70\%. This note simulates the effects of a 70\% top rate on different groups of ﬁlers and shows the impacts on revenue and macroeconomic aggregates. We ﬁnd that an increase in the top marginal tax rate to 70\% raises between \$5 billion and \$250 billion per year over the ﬁrst 10 years, depending on the size of the top bracket to which this rate is applied. However, our macroeconomic simulations show that a 70\% top rate lowers GDP by between 1.7\% and 0.1\% in the near term, although there may be positive effects on GDP in the longer term.},
